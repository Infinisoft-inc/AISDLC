Platform would use AI to create product plans, business analysis, architecture with 360-degree top-down view. Goal is to dramatically reduce development speed and make processes easier for humans. Integrated platform with voice interface (no keyboard needed).",
    "Key problems identified: Development cycles too slow and expensive, communication challenges between teams, big gap between business requirements and technical implementation, clash between business language and technical language, information overload and poor organization, steep learning curves with frameworks/syntax instead of problem-solving, spending 80% time on non-essential tasks vs 20% on actual problem-solving. Target market: entire software industry and potentially broader.",
    "Business impact: Software supposed to make life easier but often makes things more complex, significant money wasted, many project failures. Success vision: Focus on problem-solving and simplification, voice-only interface (no keyboard/mouse), dramatic improvement in technical communication. Platform provides top-down traceability from strategic vision to tasks - business requirements linked to architecture, specifications, features, tasks, code, PRs, quality control, acceptance criteria, business value. Easy navigation between detail levels with structured top-down approach covering full lifecycle from idea to delivery.",
    "Current status: Already testing/building the software (50% working from top-down approach), solo developer with zero budget, doing everything himself, timeline is ASAP, main risk is wasting time, uncertain about market adoption and competition, no monetization strategy yet, only resource is his own time and effort."
