# AI-SDLC Experiments

This directory contains documented experiments exploring various aspects of AI-assisted software development, particularly focusing on MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations and real-time data flow patterns.

## Experiment Structure

Each experiment follows a standardized documentation format:

- **Overview**: Problem statement and objectives
- **Hypothesis**: Predicted outcomes and assumptions
- **Setup**: Technical components and architecture
- **Methodology**: Step-by-step procedure
- **Results**: Actual findings and observations
- **Analysis**: Conclusions and implications

## Current Experiments

### 2025-01-06: MCP Real-time Data Injection
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Focus**: Understanding MCP server behavior with unsolicited STDIO data injection
- **Directory**: `mcp-realtime-injection/`

## Guidelines

1. **Document Before Experimenting**: Always create the experiment structure before starting
2. **Record Everything**: Capture both expected and unexpected behaviors
3. **Version Control**: Commit experiment documentation as it evolves
4. **Reproducibility**: Include enough detail for others to replicate
5. **Analysis**: Always conclude with learnings and next steps

## Contributing

When adding new experiments:
1. Create a new directory with descriptive name and date
2. Follow the standard documentation template
3. Update this README with experiment summary
4. Commit initial documentation before starting
