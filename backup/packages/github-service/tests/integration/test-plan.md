# GitHub Service Integration Test Plan

**Author:** Alex (AI Architect) & Martin Ouimet  
**Created:** June 6th, 2025  
**Purpose:** Validate GitHub Service integration with Jordan Project Manager

## Test Strategy

### Phase 1: Atomic Function Testing (Bottom-Up)
Test each building block individually before integration.

### Phase 2: Integration Testing  
Test complete workflow with realistic project structure.

### Phase 3: Jordan Integration
Integrate tested functions into Jordan's MCP tools.

## Test Environment

**Requirements:**
- GitHub App with proper permissions
- Organization access for repository creation
- Installation ID for authentication
- Test organization: [TO BE SPECIFIED]

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: E-Commerce Platform (Primary Test)
**File:** `test-scenarios/ecommerce-platform.json`
**Complexity:** 2 Epics, 4 Features, 8 Tasks
**Purpose:** Comprehensive validation of all features

### Validation Criteria

**Repository Creation:**
- ✅ Repository created successfully
- ✅ Proper naming and description
- ✅ Default branch configured
- ✅ Repository accessible via URL

**Issue Hierarchy:**
- ✅ Epic issues created with [EPIC] prefix
- ✅ Feature issues created with [FEATURE] prefix  
- ✅ Task issues created with [TASK] prefix
- ✅ Parent-child relationships visible in GitHub UI
- ✅ Issue types assigned correctly (Epic/Feature/Task)

**Branch Structure:**
- ✅ Epic branches: `epic/user-management-system`
- ✅ Feature branches: `feature/user-registration-auth`
- ✅ Task branches: `task/email-validation-system`
- ✅ All branches linked to respective issues

**GitHub Project Integration:**
- ✅ GitHub Project v2 created
- ✅ All issues added to project
- ✅ Proper categorization maintained
- ✅ Hierarchy visible in project view

**Performance:**
- ✅ Complete project creation under 60 seconds
- ✅ No rate limit errors
- ✅ All API calls successful

## Test Execution

### Manual Testing Phase
1. Execute atomic functions individually
2. Validate each result against criteria
3. Document any issues or failures
4. Fix issues before proceeding

### Automated Testing Phase  
1. Run complete project creation
2. Validate full scenario
3. Performance testing
4. Error handling validation

## Success Criteria

**Phase 1 Success:** All atomic functions work individually
**Phase 2 Success:** Complete project creation works end-to-end
**Phase 3 Success:** Jordan can create real GitHub projects

## Risk Mitigation

**Potential Issues:**
- Rate limiting during bulk operations
- Permission errors with GitHub App
- Network timeouts during creation
- Branch creation conflicts

**Mitigation:**
- Built-in retry logic in GitHub Service
- Proper error handling and logging
- Incremental testing approach
- Rollback procedures for failed tests

## Test Results Location

**Results Directory:** `results/`
**Naming Convention:** `test-results-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
**Content:** Detailed pass/fail status for each test criteria

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed test scenario data
2. Execute Phase 1 atomic testing
3. Document results and issues
4. Proceed to integration testing
5. Integrate with Jordan MCP tools

**Status:** Ready for test scenario creation and execution
