## 🔍 What is AI-SDLC?

AI-SDLC is an experimental approach to software development that uses AI assistants to help with various stages of the development lifecycle. Currently, it focuses on business analysis and project management automation.

The system explores how AI can assist with:
- Converting business conversations into structured documents
- Automating GitHub project setup and management
- Streamlining stakeholder communication
- Managing project workflows

## 🤖 Current AI Assistants

### �‍💼 Sarah - AI Business Analyst
An AI assistant that helps with business analysis and project management tasks.

**Current Capabilities:**
- Processes business conversations and requirements
- Generates business case documents with financial analysis
- Creates structured requirements documentation
- Manages GitHub project workflows and issue tracking
- Automates stakeholder notifications and status updates

**Note:** Sarah is a prototype AI assistant designed to explore business analysis automation.

### 🔮 Planned AI Assistants
- **Project Manager** - Task coordination and project planning
- **Developer** - Code generation and development assistance
- **QA Engineer** - Testing and quality assurance automation
- **DevOps Engineer** - Deployment and infrastructure management

**Note:** These are planned components not yet implemented.

## 🔄 How the System Works

### **Step 1: Business Input**
User provides business requirements through conversation or documentation.

### **Step 2: Analysis & Documentation**
Sarah processes the input and generates:
- Business case documents with financial analysis
- Structured requirements and specifications
- Risk assessment and project planning
- Implementation roadmaps

### **Step 3: Project Setup**
The system creates GitHub project structure:
- Repository setup with proper organization
- Issues organized as Epic → Feature → Task hierarchy
- Project management boards and workflows
- Branch and development structure

### **Step 4: Workflow Management**
Automated project management:
- Stakeholder notifications and updates
- Status tracking and reporting
- Document version control
- Team coordination

### **Step 5: Development Ready**
Output includes structured project ready for development team.
