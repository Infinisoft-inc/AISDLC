## Evolution from Simple Project to Structured Methodology

**AI-SDLC v2** is the structured evolution of our experimental approach that began with the [Si Simple Project](https://github.com/mouimet-infinisoft/si-simple). What started as an exploration of AI-human collaboration has evolved into a documented methodology that's proven to work, but still experimental and evolving.

### üîÑ From Experiment to Structured Approach

**Si Simple Project (v1)** was our proof-of-concept that demonstrated AI could handle end-to-end development. **AI-SDLC v2** takes those learnings and creates a structured, documented methodology with:

- **Formal phase structure** with clear deliverables and approval gates
- **Specialized AI roles** (Business Analyst, Architect, Developer, QA Engineer)
- **Complete traceability** from business requirements to delivered code
- **Domain-driven development** approach for complex applications
- **Documented templates** and process guidelines

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental Status**: While proven to work in real projects, this methodology is still experimental. We're actively learning, refining, and improving based on real-world usage. Phase 3.2 (Deployment) is particularly experimental and requires human oversight.

### üöÄ Proven Results: From 24 Hours to Production

Our methodology has been validated through real-world applications:

- **Voice-Driven AI-SDLC**: Built a complete Bus Driver Evaluation Report Generator in 24 hours (read the [case study](https://blog.infinisoft.world/posts/voice-driven-ai-sdlc-case-study))

### üîÑ Shift Your Focus from Code to Strategy

This isn't about replacing developers - it's about transforming their role:

- **Strategic Direction**: Define clear goals and requirements
- **Domain Expertise**: Focus on understanding the problem deeply
- **AI Delegation**: Let AI handle implementation details
- **Quality Oversight**: Maintain control of the final solution
