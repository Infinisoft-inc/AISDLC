## Epic Dependencies

### Dependency Chain
1. **EPIC 1** (MCP Service Integration) → Foundation for all other EPICs
2. **EPIC 2** (Voice Processing) → Can be developed in parallel with EPIC 1
3. **EPIC 3** (LLM Codebase Interaction) → Depends on EPIC 1 completion

### Critical Path
**EPIC 1 → EPIC 3** forms the critical path for core functionality  
**EPIC 2** can be developed independently and integrated

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 2 Approach
Following AI-SDLC methodology, each EPIC will be implemented through the Phase 2 cycle:

1. **Phase 2.1:** Functional Requirements Specification (FRS) for selected EPIC
2. **Phase 2.2:** Implementation Plan for the EPIC
3. **Phase 2.3:** Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) with GitHub issues
4. **Phase 2.4:** Code Development and implementation

### Recommended Implementation Order
1. **Start with EPIC 1** - Establish MCP foundation
2. **Parallel development of EPIC 2** - Voice processing capabilities
3. **Complete with EPIC 3** - LLM integration and full workflow

---

## Success Metrics

### Overall Project Success
- All 3 EPICs completed and integrated
- End-to-end voice-driven development assistance functional
- Service deployed and ready for client use
- AI-SDLC methodology validated through implementation

### Individual EPIC Success
Each EPIC must meet its defined success criteria before proceeding to the next phase or EPIC.
