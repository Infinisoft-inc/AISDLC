# Roles and Responsibilities in AI-Human Collaboration

This document outlines the key roles and responsibilities for both humans and AI assistants in the collaborative development process.

## Human Role (Strategic)

Humans are responsible for strategic direction and final decision-making:

- Define business problems and requirements
- Make key architectural and technology decisions
- Review and approve AI-generated content and code
- Provide domain expertise and context
- Set priorities and make final decisions
- Execute deployment steps requiring authentication

## AI Role (Tactical)

AI assistants excel at implementation and support:

- Expand high-level requirements into detailed specifications
- Generate code based on approved specifications
- Create documentation and test cases
- Propose solutions to technical challenges
- Explain technical concepts and trade-offs
- Provide implementation options for human decision

## Effective Collaboration

Successful collaboration requires:

1. **Clear Communication**: Precise instructions and feedback
2. **Defined Boundaries**: Understanding the limits of each role
3. **Iterative Process**: Building solutions incrementally
4. **Continuous Learning**: Improving collaboration over time
