# Beyond Vibe Coding: Introducing AI-Powered SDLC for Real-World Solutions

## Article Outline

### 1. The Reality Check on Vibe Coding
- Acknowledge vibe coding's popularity for quick demos and simple applications
- Highlight how vibe coding keeps developers focused on HOW (syntax, code generation) rather than elevating their role
- Explain its limitations for real-world business problems:
  - Difficulty integrating with existing codebases
  - Lack of contextual understanding for complex business requirements
  - Challenges scaling beyond simple applications
- [Video element: Brief demonstration showing vibe coding limitations with a real-world scenario]

### 2. Introducing AI-Powered SDLC: A Strategic Software Engineering Approach to Development
- Introduce your methodology with the term "AI-Powered SDLC" (or "AI-SDLC")
- Emphasize how AI-SDLC transforms the developer's role to focus on WHAT and WHY:
  - Strategic direction and intentional development with clear goals
  - Problem-solving focused on domain expertise
  - Delegating syntax and code generation to AI, which excels at these tasks
- Brief explanation of how it combines established software engineering principles with AI capabilities
- [Video element: Quick overview of the AI-SDLC approach showing this role transformation]

### 3. Case Study: From Handwritten Notes to Professional Reports
- The real-world problem: Converting bus driver evaluations into structured reports
- Highlight the dramatic efficiency gain - creating the entire application in 24 hours without writing a single line of code
- Emphasize that a traditional approach would have taken 4-6 months with a team of developers
- Show how the focus was on solving the business problem rather than coding details
- How AI-SDLC was applied to build a complete solution through partnership with AI
- The results: A deployed application solving an actual business need
- [Video element: Demonstration of the application in action]
- [Link to the live application for readers to explore]
