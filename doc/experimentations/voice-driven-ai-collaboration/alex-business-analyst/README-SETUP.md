# Alex Business Analyst - MCP Server Setup

## üéØ **Alex is Ready for Augment Extension!**

### **What's Been Created:**

1. **Alex MCP Server** (`src/alex-mcp-server.ts`)
   - Persistent memory system
   - Intelligent business case discovery
   - Three main tools for interaction

2. **VS Code Configuration** (`.vscode/settings.json`)
   ```json
   {
     "augment.mcpServers": {
       "alex-business-analyst": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["packages/alex-business-analyst/dist/src/alex-mcp-server.js"],
         "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
         "env": {}
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Global MCP Configuration** (`mcp_settings.json`)
   - Alternative configuration file for MCP servers

### **Available Tools in Augment:**

#### üó£Ô∏è **talk-to-alex**
- **Purpose**: Have conversations with Alex
- **Input**: `message` (string) - Your message to Alex
- **Output**: Alex's intelligent response with memory persistence

#### üìä **alex-status** 
- **Purpose**: Check Alex's current memory and project context
- **Input**: None
- **Output**: Complete status including conversation history, learnings, and project state

#### üîÑ **reset-alex**
- **Purpose**: Reset Alex's memory (use with caution)
- **Input**: `confirm` (string) - Type "CONFIRM" to reset
- **Output**: Confirmation of memory reset

### **How Alex Works:**

1. **Persistent Memory**: Alex remembers all conversations in `alex-memory.json`
2. **Learning System**: Alex learns your communication style and preferences
3. **Project Context**: Alex maintains awareness of current projects and business cases
4. **Intelligent Engagement**: Alex asks strategic questions and challenges off-topic responses

### **To Start Using Alex:**

1. **Build Alex** (if needed):
   ```bash
   cd packages/alex-business-analyst
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Test MCP Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run mcp
   ```

3. **Use in Augment Extension**:
   - Open VS Code with Augment extension
   - Alex should appear as an available MCP server
   - Use the `talk-to-alex` tool to start conversations

### **Example Conversation:**

```
Tool: talk-to-alex
Message: "Hi Alex, I'm working on a new AI-powered customer service platform"

Alex Response: "Excellent! I understand we're working on an AI-powered customer service platform. As your business analyst, I need to gather comprehensive information to create a solid business case.

Let's start with the foundation: What specific problem are we trying to solve with this platform?

I need to understand the core issue that's driving this initiative."
```

### **Alex's Memory System:**

Alex maintains several types of persistent memory:

- **User Profile**: Your name, communication style, preferences
- **Project Context**: Current project details, phase, decisions
- **Conversation History**: All interactions with importance levels
- **Business Case Progress**: Completed sections, missing information
- **Learnings**: Patterns and insights about working with you

### **Troubleshooting:**

If Alex doesn't appear in Augment:
1. Check that the build completed successfully
2. Verify the paths in `.vscode/settings.json` are correct
3. Restart VS Code to reload MCP server configurations
4. Check the Augment extension logs for connection errors

### **Next Steps:**

1. Start a conversation with Alex using `talk-to-alex`
2. Let Alex guide you through business case discovery
3. Use `alex-status` to see how Alex's memory evolves
4. Build a complete business case for your AI-SDLC project

**Alex is your persistent AI business analyst teammate - ready to remember everything and help you succeed!** üöÄ
