# MCP Real-time Data Injection Experiment

**Date**: 2025-01-06  
**Experimenter**: AI Agent + Martin Ouimet  
**Status**: Planning Phase

## Overview

### Problem Statement
Understanding how Augment Code behaves when an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server receives unsolicited real-time data and attempts to pass it to the AI agent through STDIO injection, particularly when the agent is not actively calling MCP functions.

### Objectives
1. Determine if STDIO injection can successfully deliver real-time data to Augment Code
2. Understand agent behavior patterns during active conversation vs. idle periods
3. Identify potential integration patterns for pub/sub architectures with MCP servers
4. Document any unexpected behaviors or failure modes

## Hypothesis & Assumptions

### Primary Hypothesis
When real-time data is injected into the MCP server's STDIO stream, Augment Code will either:
- **Best Case**: Process the data as contextual information
- **Most Likely**: Ignore non-JSON-RPC formatted data
- **Worst Case**: Interpret it as malformed MCP messages and disconnect

### Behavioral Predictions

#### During Active Conversation
- Agent might process updates immediately
- Potential interruption of conversation flow
- Possible queuing of responses
- Context switching challenges

#### During Idle Periods
- Updates might accumulate silently
- Could trigger autonomous responses
- May influence next interaction context

#### Technical Assumptions
- MCP servers run asynchronously
- STDIO is the primary communication channel
- JSON-RPC protocol expectations may be strict
- Real-time subscriptions could create event floods

## Technical Setup

### Infrastructure Components
- **Cloud Platform**: Existing AI-SDLC infrastructure
- **Database**: Supabase (cloud-hosted)
- **Application**: Next.js with Supabase integration
- **Payment**: Stripe integration (configured)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with subscription management
- **Real-time**: Supabase real-time subscriptions

### MCP Architecture
- **MCP Server**: Custom server with Supabase client
- **Communication**: STDIO-based JSON-RPC
- **Data Flow**: Supabase → MCP Server → STDIO → Augment Code

### Test Environment
- **Status**: Empty production-ready environment
- **Advantage**: No risk to existing data
- **Flexibility**: Full control over test scenarios

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Environment Setup
1. Connect to cloud Supabase instance
2. Install Supabase CLI and configure local access
3. Create test table for real-time events (`mcp_events`)
4. Set up MCP server with Supabase client integration

### Phase 2: Basic STDIO Injection Test
1. Create simple real-time subscription in MCP server
2. Inject test data into STDIO stream
3. Monitor Augment Code behavior
4. Document immediate responses or failures

### Phase 3: Conversation State Testing
1. **Active Conversation Test**:
   - Start conversation with agent
   - Trigger real-time updates during dialogue
   - Observe response patterns and context handling

2. **Idle State Test**:
   - Leave agent idle
   - Trigger updates
   - Monitor for autonomous responses or state changes

### Phase 4: Load and Pattern Testing
1. **Single Update**: Test individual event processing
2. **Burst Updates**: Test rapid-fire event handling
3. **Different Data Types**: Test various payload formats
4. **Large Payloads**: Test size limitations

## Expected Outcomes

### Success Indicators
- Data successfully reaches Augment Code
- Agent maintains conversation context
- Predictable behavior patterns emerge
- No system crashes or disconnections

### Failure Indicators
- MCP connection drops
- Agent becomes unresponsive
- Malformed message errors
- Context corruption

## Risk Mitigation
- Use isolated test environment
- Start with minimal data payloads
- Have MCP server restart procedure ready
- Document all failure modes for learning
